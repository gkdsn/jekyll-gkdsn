  this historic luxury hotel and botanical garden on the web.

      I created a straight forward, adaptive design system that enables the
      client to create and adjust page content without assistance. The block
      design system provides building blocks for this; each meticulously
      designed to fit in any order. I kept the aesthetic clean and minimal to
      support the branding, whilst adding elements of flair through
      interactivity.


      I aided the development team by writing CSS for the motion and some interactivity, as well as creating the mouse follower and logo animations.
