seo: Moodelier believe that creativity and great visuals should never be stifled
  by cost. They provide artists, makers and creators with the resources to learn
  and create; through their educational courses and their creative and unique
  pieces. I helped NARI bring the creative direction to life on the web,
  implementing various features on the site to create an equally creative and
  unique web experience.
