seo: Dishoom pays homage to the Irani cafés and the food of all Bombay in
  locations throughout the UK. I worked with Damn Fine to refresh the Dishoom
  website to better represent the ethos and mission of Dishoom, allow the guests
  to better understand the work they do within their communities and provide a
  platform for the company to grow.

    copy: I single-handedly created a completely unique digital direction, taking
      inspiration from Dishoom’s wealth of creative assets and archive.
      Conceptually, the site represents a 1970s Bombay newspaper which would be
      commonplace in the Irani cafés of the time. I worked in a rich tapestry
      of visual languages to create templates for the Parsi Ads - which decorate
      the site as promotional material.
