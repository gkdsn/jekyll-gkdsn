  - desc: Process
    body: I believe that the best outcomes come from a refined concept and through
      close collaboration. I use an iterative, modular approach to design and
      development - creating building blocks from a full-scale design system -
      which creates a website that allows for a huge range of customisation. My
      ideology is that obtaining feedback regularly keeps us working on the same
      page, allowing for your vision to be fully expressed efficiently.
  - desc: Experience & Expertise
    body: I call upon over 8 years of high quality experience working on websites. I
      studied Architecture as an undergraduate which taught me an understanding
      of how to design for people interacting with their surroundings; something
      that has proven incredibly valuable when designing a user experience. I am
      a Shopify Partner, a featured Webflow Creator, have an advanced knowledge
      of Wordpress and a solid knowledge of static site generators and headless
      CMS. I recommend the very best CMS as per the requirements of each
      project. All of my sites are created using hand-written code that complies
      with current best practices, are super fast loading, accessible and
      semantically written for great SEO.
  - desc: Belief
    body: I am passionate about the power of good design and quality craftsmanship
      and gravitate towards projects that portray these. I am also a proud
      advocate for many social causes including sustainability, mental health
      and gender equality. I love working on projects that have a purpose-led
      agenda - if you feel like this may be you, please get in touch.
